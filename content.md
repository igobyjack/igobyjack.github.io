# Hello!

I'm Jack, and currently a senior in high school, thank you for visiting!

I'm currently a researcher in the Center of Autonomy at the University of Texas at Austin, where I work on a variety of projects related to applications of autonomous systems, maths, physics, and computer science as I study aerospace engineering with a minor in computer science. 

You can check out some of my past projects on this page, or on my Github @igobyjack.

# More about what i'm interested in

For how young the fields of aerospace and computing are, they've changed everything about the way we live. What I'm exploring is how computing can be applied to solve problems in aerospace, an industry tied to the furthering of our understanding.

# Site info

The above simulation of the 3-body problem was built by me in JavaScript, you can check it out on the repository for this site. If you didn't notice, you can click and drag the planets around and see the changes in behavior. I don't think this works on mobile.
